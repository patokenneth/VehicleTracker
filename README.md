# VehicleTracker
A project to record, update and fetch the locations of vehicles.

## Description
In this project, I have built a web API to simulate a vehicle tracking platform. The web API receives the vehicle location coordinates, records the information and spits the location if required.

## Getting Started
This project is on my github repo and has one branch: main. Start by cloning the main branch of the repo. Afterwards, restore the NuGet packages 
and run migration (both the add-migration and update-database commands). As a way of seeding an admin user, I have a default user whose username is Seven and the password is Sev7T. The admin 
user is able to register other users and also fetch the vehicle location. If you have followed the instructions above, the solution should start up on swagger when you run it.

### Dependencies

To successfully run this project, you need to have the following software updates installed:
* .NET 5 SDK or above (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)

### Installing
